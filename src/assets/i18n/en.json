  "aboutUsText": "We are not your one-night pizza. We want quality, even if you eat it in the car. We are not the purest, we didn't invent pizzas. We are the guardians of its true essence. Lovers of BACK TO PIZZA. The one that fills you up, the one that nourishes you. The texture of the pizza, the smoothness of the cheese... We feel every bite like a first kiss. The one that comes with its thin crust and tasty ingredients... The one you won't regret. THE ONE THAT MAKES US PROUD.",
